This is Stefan's UCM Marble Project supervised by Ammar. Hi


*Main folder of 1. Period: featureSelection*

featureSelection folder

8. Today: Explore Cell Representation & Look at the 2 research tasks & check meeting file

7. *dataStudy* 1) shows why values are missing 2) attempts predictions on other indicators 3) produces Fingerprint data
6. *comparingMethods* (former delete.ipynb) I build mutliple models, drop features by correlation etc and find that the predictive power found before is actually not so good as thought
4. & 5. *featureSelection2 & 3* extend @3 training regressors, add MACCSKeys to show feat rankings and seems like really good predictions


old notebooks in main folder
3. *featureSelection.ipynb* generates all the chemicmal rdkit properties and joins them with the drug frames -> pickles
2. *firstOwnRegression* was the first model building attempt, making a linear regression model similar to the solubility article
1. *ExplorationsDrugCombDB* was the first exploration file - I produced some pickles there such as the doubling of the data



implement competition's evaluation metrics

MAKE BETTER DESCRIPTION WITH LINKS AND DOWNLOAD TIMES OF FILES


apply dummyclassifier to both old model 500k data and new model 




look up astracenca comptetion, compare to their models
